# Hello, my name is Teresa Fuckyouimnotputtingmylastnameheresuckmycock [^lastname]
#### She/Her
I am, well... I don't fuckin know.  
I just do random shit sometimes, I am basically the programming equivalent of a shitposter.  
If you try to hire me, don't. 
## Fun facts with Teresa:
- I hate python.  
- Programming is like chess, I have no clue what the fuck I am doing but it some how works, or fails horribly, one or the other.  
- Life is like chess, I suck at chess  
- Unlike life, I don't stay up at night crying and nearly killing myself over fucking chess.
- I need to stop adding fun facts
- Nothing I do here is practical
- *Insert some anarchist shit here*
- Trans rights 

[^lastname]: That is in fact ~~not~~ my last name
