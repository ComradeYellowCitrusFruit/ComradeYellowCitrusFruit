## Fun facts with Teresa:
- I hate python.  
- Programming is like chess, I have no clue what the fuck I am doing but it some how works, or fails horribly, one or the other.  
- Life is like chess, I suck at chess  
- Unlike life, I don't stay up at night crying and nearly killing myself over fucking chess.
- I need to stop adding fun facts
- Nothing I do here is practical
- *Insert some anarchist shit here*
- Trans rights 
- I am technically banned from Belarus
- I do not recognize Discord.js any more
