## Hello,
### my name is Teresa Fuckyouimnotputtingmylastnameheresuckmycock
she/her  
I am, well... I don't fuckin know.  
I just do random shit sometimes, I am basically the programming equivalent of a shitposter.  
Fun fact: I hate python.  
If you try to hire me, don't.  
That's all, for now, at least.
